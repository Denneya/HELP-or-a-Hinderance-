# HELP-or-a-Hinderance- ðŸ†˜
Testing out my new Tableau skills, I decided to look at Student HELP Loans in Australia as the 7% index will hit us very soon!

## Student HELP Loans

### A â€˜HELPâ€™ or a hinderance?

Australian citizens have been given access to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) since 1989. Now replaced by the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), students undertaking tertiary studies are able to defer their university fees until they reach the minimum threshold of $47 014. It has been said that a 'HELP' debt is a loan without interest (except for the indexation). This year, Australian's are dreading June 31st as the index rate has been raised to 7%. This feels a lot like interest and will add thousands and thousands of dollars to students' loans each year, as well as adding years onto the repayment time.

Looking at data from 2006 to 2022, it is clear that the amount students are having to pay back is increasing each year. Are these debts increasing so much that people are unable to pay them off in full? Figure 1 identifies that in the 2005-06 financial year, people with HELP loans began to make voluntary payments after 6.8 years of entering the workforce. However, now people are requiring almost a whole year longer to make a voluntary repayment, even though the minimum wage in Australia has since increased from $13.47/h to $21.38/h.

Not only has the student fees increased for each student, there is a large disparity between the total HELP debt for Males and Females. Figure 2 identifies this gap has existed since 2006, however the difference in debt amount has been increasing more and more each year. In 2022, there are 1.83 million females with a HELP debt, compared to the 1.17 males. This is a large difference considering women make up 47.4% of the workforce. However, this disparity could be explained by a number of factors such as:

1. There are a greater number of men who choose to undertake a trade or apprenticeship compared to women.
2. There are more females (50.21%) that make up the Australian population.
3. Women currently represent 60.4% of all completed undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Australia.

Figure 2. Number of debtors, filtered by sex from 2006-2022.

In regards to comparing the total amount of HELP debt between males and females, Figure 3 provides evidence of the increasing divide between the sexes. This divide reached its peak in 2019 where the total HELP debt for females in Australia reached $4.82 billion, compared to the $3.51 billion for males. These figures have since grown, however the gap has remained this large. With research, the reasons behind this gap could come down to females leaving the workforce to have children and look after them until they begin daycare or school, meaning they do not reach the minimum threshold for HELP repayments. This gap can also come down to the gender inequality of pay. Are men able to pay off their HELP debts faster as they earn more?

Figure 4 identifies the spread of HELP debtors in Australia, identifying NSW to be the state with the most citizens with a HELP debt.

So, is this Government scheme a â€˜HELPâ€™ or a hinderance? Is this allowing citizens of Australia to increase their skill levels without discrimination, or is it hindering their opportunities in the future due to having to pay off a debt that is on average more than $36 000? Figure 5 shows a forecast of the next three years of the total incurred debt, as well as the compulsory repayments for HELP debtors. With the cost of living also increasing in Australia, will people be able to keep up with the increasing compulsory repayments or will they choose a different pathway to avoid this HELP debt? Paying off student loans has to be equal and accessible to all. There is strong evidence suggesting that this is not the case and never has been.
